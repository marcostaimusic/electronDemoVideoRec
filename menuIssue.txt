If you're using electron 12+ and getting an error about Menu not initialized: 
1) npm install --save @electron/remote (installs the new remote module) 
2) Change the const {Menu} to: const { Menu } = require('@electron/remote'); 
3) Add this: require('@electron/remote/main').initialize()           to index.js (aka the main process).

Remote was deprecated in v12 and removed in v14, where it was replaced by @electron/remote with breaking changes.

This got me close enough to figure things out with help from the docs.

I would change step 3 to : 
3) add "const remote = require('@electron/remote/main')" to index.js followed by "remote.initialize()"

then add two steps of : 
4) within the createWindow function, add "contextIsolation: false," to the webPreferences object
5) within the createWindow function but outside where mainWindow is made, add the line "remote.enable(mainWindow.webContents)"

This should make it so you are able to get the list of input sources upon pressing the corresponding button.

Please note that these breaking changes were instituted for security reasons and the modern/recommended way to perform these functions now is by using a preload script where you create specific APIs to expose in the renderer.
